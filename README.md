# Avoid the O's
This is a game written in TI-Basic 83, intended for the 83+/84+ lines of TI calculators. There are two versions: AVOIDOBW.8xp, which is for monochrome calculators (supports TI-83+, 84+, and 84+ SE) and AVOIDOC.8xp, which is for calculators with a color display (TI-84+ CSE, TI-84+ CE). There are two seperate versions because the monochrome calculators have different screen dimensions compared to the color calculators. That said, both versions of the game itself are monochrome.
In this game, you play as an X and try to avoid O's. If you touch an O, the game ends, and you lose. Ideally, you should reach the goal, which is a randomly spawned W.
The movement pattern of O's is randomly generated.
There are two ways to play: 
1. Play on real hardware. To do so, use TI Connect (or, optionally, TI Connect CE, if you own a TI-84+ CSE or CE) and send the AVOIDO.8xp file to your calculator while it is plugged into your computer. After the data transfer is complete, press PRGM on your calculator. You should see AVOIDO. Under the EXEC menu, navigate to AVOIDO and press Enter.
2. Play on an emulator. If you wish to play this game legally, you still need a physical calculator for this step. Use rom8x (https://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/fileinfo/373/37341.html) and follow its respective README to find out how to dump your calculator's ROM. There are many TI emulators available, so do your research. If you wish to use Wabbitemu, navigate to File->Open, then browse your file explorer for AVOIDO.8xp. If you do not see a calculator interface, navigate to View, and check Enable Skin. From this point on, the steps to opening the program are identical to playing on real hardware. 

I hope you enjoy! :)
